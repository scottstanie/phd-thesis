\chapter{Robust Time Series Methods for Long-term Nonlinear Deformation}
\label{CHAP:5-robust-ts}


In this chapter, we present a method for robustly extracting slowly-varying surface deformation over long time periods.
% from time series with large noise. 
We perform a temporal smoothing using the robust Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) technique \cite{Cleveland1979RobustLocallyWeighted} on noisy surface deformation time series derived using SBAS.
%The method extends the ideas behind the outlier-removal technique presented in Chapter \ref{CHAP:4-GRL}.
Compared to the alternatives presenting in Section \ref{sec:ch4-method-compare}, the LOWESS smoothing more easily accounts for nonlinear deformation while also suppressing the strong summer tropospheric noise (10-15 cm).
We demonstrate the technique using synthetic time series and using three paths of Sentinel-1 data over the Permian Basin in West Texas. 
The cumulative results show subtle basin-wide uplift features arising after 4-5 years of heavy sustained wastewater injection.



%- Problem: 
%1. Longer time series, the linear assumption becomes less valid.  This is at odds with the balance of using more measurements to average out tropospheric noise
%2. Methods incorporating temporal smoothness constraints (Find a few. e.g. Karissa? other temp smooth solvers...) or temp lienar filtering methods get influenced by strong tropo days. Even with smoothing, there are anomalous bumps 
%	- can get interpreted as deformation if we assume that all movements remaining after filtering are due to the low-pass deformation

\section{Algorithm}
%	\bm{A \phi} = \bm{\Delta \phi} + \bm{\epsilon} . \label{eq:ch2-sbas-A}
%where  $\bm{A}$ is the system design matrix, and $ \bm{\epsilon}  $ is the vector of interferogram-specific noise sources (e.g. $ \Delta \phi_{decor}, \Delta \phi_{unwrap}, \Delta \phi_{scat}, \Delta \phi_{n} $ from Equation \eqref{eq:ch2-insar-noise-terms}).
Consider a time series of $N$ LOS phase delays for a single pixel,  $ \bm{\phi} = \left[\phi_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_{N-1} \right]^T $ sampled at time intervals $ \bm{t} = \left[t_0, \ldots, t_{N-1} \right]^T $, solved from the SBAS linear system (Equation \eqref{eq:ch2-sbas-A}).
We can write each element $\phi_i$ as a sum of surface deformation and atmospheric delay,
\begin{equation}
	\phi_i = \frac{4 \pi}{\lambda} \left(d_i + \alpha_i \right)
\end{equation}
where $ d_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are the surface deformation and atmospheric delay on the $i$th day, and $ \lambda $ is the radar wavelength.
Here we consider the case that the interferogram-specific noise sources (e.g. $  \Delta \phi_{decor}, \Delta \phi_{unwrap}, \Delta \phi_{scat}  $) have been properly accounted for in the inversion process so that the remaining noise in  $ \bm{\phi} $ is predominantly from the atmospheric delay $ \bm{\alpha} =\left[\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_{N-1} \right]^T $.
%Since deformation is usually the quantity of interest,
Our goal is to separate the vector of surface deformation $ \bm{d} =  \left[d_0, d_1, \ldots, d_{N-1} \right]^T $ from the atmospheric noise $ \bm{\alpha} $.
% consists of all terms in Equation \eqref{eq:ch2-insar-noise-terms} which affect the phase of a SAR acquisition and all interferograms containing that acquisition

The most widely used non-parametric methods for separating $ \bm{d} $ from $ \bm{\alpha} $ rely on the fact that the turbulent component of $\bm{\alpha}$ is uncorrelated in time, while most deformation sources show strong temporal correlation.
%There are several approaches to separating $ \bm{d} $ from $ \bm{\alpha} $.
%If a functional model of deformation is known to exist (e.g. linear, transient jumps \citep{Chen20142010SlowSlip, Fielding2017SurfaceDeformationNorth}, seasonal variations \citep{Murray2018ShortLivedPause}, or a combination \citep{Riel2018QuantifyingGroundDeformation}), a model fit can be performed on the noisy $ \bm{\phi} $ time series to extract the model parameters of interest.
%However, when the deformation model is not known, methods usually rely on the fact that the turbulent component of $\bm{\alpha}$ is uncorrelated in time \citep{Emardson2003NeutralAtmosphericDelay} while most deformation sources show strong temporal correlation.
For example, the authors of \cite{Ferretti2000NonlinearSubsidenceRate} and \cite{Berardino2002NewAlgorithmSurface} estimated $\bm{\alpha}$ by performing a high-pass temporal filter on each pixel followed by spatially low pass filtering the residual phase.
The temporal high pass filter was implemented by subtracting a low-pass filtered version of $ \bm{\phi} $ (using a triangular filter in \cite{Ferretti2000NonlinearSubsidenceRate}) from the original unfiltered version.
% (i.e. $ \phi $)
%used spatial and temporal filters on $\bm{\Delta \phi}$.
%These filters are expanded upon and compared in Chapter \ref{CHAP:5-robust-ts}, where a new robust filter is presented to separate deformation from atmospheric noise.
One difficulty with the triangular filter and linear methods enforcing temporal smoothness
% other moving-average filters (e.g. a Gaussian filter) 
is that the filter coefficients are non-adaptive; noisier atmospheric conditions will be weighted the same as calmer conditions \citep{Liu2012SatelliteRadarInterferometry}.
This can cause considerable leakage of noise from severe weather conditions into the deformation estimate of adjacent days (e.g. the regularized solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch4-compare-ts}a).

% From Liu, 2012
% Given a good spatial density of coherent targets and a short satellite repeat orbit the filtering method used in the standard PSInSAR (see Ferretti et al. (2000)) provides a simple and fast means to separate APS from temporally correlated deformation signal. However, the separation is usually not optimal and can be erroneous when there are acquisition gaps in the time series or for acquisitions taken under extreme weather conditions such as thunderstorms. This is because the approach weights APS equally for all acquisitions and remove it by a window-based (e.g., triangle, Gaussian) temporal low-pass filter. The filter is not adaptive and its parameters (e.g., temporal correlation length) are up to the users to specify. A good filter, however, should weight APS per acquisition differently according to its significance and be self-adjustable based on the input data to optimize its parameters towards an optimal filtering.

\end{figure}


We can adaptively filter the noisy $ \bm{\phi} $ time series by implementing a robust LOWESS regression \citep{Cleveland1979RobustLocallyWeighted}. The LOWESS algorithm fits a local linear regression at every $t_i$ using nearby data points, repeating over multiple iterations to refine the fit and reduce the effect of outliers \citep{Efron2019ComputerAgeStatistical}.
% which performs several iterations of weighted linear regression for each SAR acquisition. 
For the first iteration, at each time $t_i$,  we calculate a set of weights $\bm{w}(t_i)$. The weight function has a maximum value of $1$ at $t_i$ and decays to zero at the $r$th nearest neighbor to $t_i$, where $r = \left\lfloor \gamma N \right\rfloor$, $0 < \gamma \leq 1$ is the fraction of the data chosen to include for each local fit, and $ \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor $ is rounds $ x $ down to the next lowest integer.
Let $h_i$ be the $r$th smallest number of $\left| x_i - x_k \right|$ for $ k = 0, \ldots, N-1 $.
The $k$th weight $w_k(t_i)$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
	w_k(t_i) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\left( 1 - \left|\frac{t_i - t_k}{h_i} \right|^3 \right)^3 , & \text{if}\  \left|\frac{t_i - t_k}{h_i} \right| < 1 \\
		0, & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}          \label{eq:ch5-lowess-weights}
\end{equation}
for $k =0, \ldots, N-1 $. This weight function is known as the \emph{tricube} weighting function.
Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-window} illustrates the shape of  $ \bm{w}(t_i) $ for $\gamma = 1/6, 1/3$ and  $1/2 $.



Using $ \bm{w}(t_i) $, we compute a weighted linear regression around $t_i$ by finding the intercept and slope, $a_i, b_i$ that minimize
%\begin{equation}
%		\begin{bmatrix}
%		1, t_0 \\
%		1, t_1 \\
%		\ldots \\
%		1, t_{N-1} \\
%	\end{bmatrix}
%	\begin{bmatrix}
%		a_i \\ b_i
%	\end{bmatrix}
%= \bm{\phi}
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} w_k(t_i) \left(\phi_k - a_i - b_i t_k \right)^2
\end{equation}
The smoothed estimate $\hat{\phi}_i$ at the point $t_i$ is calculated as $\hat{\phi}_i = a_i + t_i b_i$. This process is repeated for all $t_i$,  $i = 0, \ldots, N-1$.

The second iteration performs another weighted least squares fit, this time further downweighting based on the residuals of the first iteration.
Let $\epsilon_k = \left| \hat{\phi}_k - \phi_k  \right|$ be the residual at $t_k$ and $s$ be the median residual for all $k$. We create an additional set of weights $ \delta_k $ for each $ k = 0, \ldots, N-1$ as
\begin{equation}
	\delta_k = 
	\begin{cases}
		\left( 1 - \left(\frac{ \hat{\phi}_k - \phi_k }{6 s} \right)^2 \right)^2 , & \text{if}\  \left( \frac{ \hat{\phi}_k - \phi_k }{6s} \right) < 1 \\
		0, & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}          \label{eq:ch5-lowess-weights2}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:ch5-lowess-weights2} uses the median $ s $ so that large outliers are clipped to 0, similar to the use of the median absolute deviation from Section \ref{sec:ch4-outlier-method}. For each new fit in the second iteration, the weights $ \bm{w}(t_i) $ are multiplied by the residual weights $\bm{\delta}$ to perform the local regressions.

Finally, we perform a shift of $ \bm{\hat{\phi}} $ to compensate for the first day's atmospheric conditions by setting $ \hat{\phi}_i = \hat{\phi}_i - \hat{\phi}_0 $ for all $ i = 1, \ldots, N-1 $.
This step is necessary for $ \bm{\phi} $ solved using the SBAS formulation of Equation \eqref{eq:ch2-sbas-A}; since the first date's phase is assumed to be 0, $ \alpha_0 $ is added to all other dates.
While \cite{Ferretti2000NonlinearSubsidenceRate} uses mean value of the common-reference interferogram phases as an estimation of the first date's atmospheric noise, here we use the y-intercept of the smoothed time series, $ \hat{\phi}_0 $, as an estimate of $ \alpha_0 $. 


%
%%$ \bm{v} = (\bm{A}^T \bm{A})^{-1}\bm{A}^T \bm{\Delta \phi} $
%%As noted in \cite{Simons2007InterferometricSyntheticAperture}, 
%The least squares solution $ \bm{v} = (\bm{B}^T \bm{B})^{-1}\bm{B}^T \bm{\Delta \phi} $ (or minimum norm solution n $ \bm{v} = \bm{B}^{\dagger} \bm{\Delta \phi}$ ) from \cite{Berardino2002NewAlgorithmSurface} assume that all measurements in $\bm{\Delta \phi}$ have equal variance; subsequent authors have implemented a weighted least squares solution:
%\begin{equation}
%	%	\bm{\phi} = \bm{A}^{\dagger} \bm{\Delta \phi}
%	%	\bm{\phi} = (\bm{A}^T \bm{\Sigma}^{-1} \bm{A})^{-1}\bm{A}^T \bm{\Sigma}^{-1} \bm{\Delta \phi}  \label{eq:ch2-sbas-wls}
%	\bm{v} = (\bm{B}^T \bm{\Sigma}^{-1} \bm{B})^{-1}\bm{B}^T \bm{\Sigma}^{-1} \bm{\Delta \phi}  \label{eq:ch2-sbas-wls}
%\end{equation}
%where $ \bm{\Sigma} = \mathbb{E}[\bm{\epsilon} \bm{\epsilon}^T] $ is the measurement covariance matrix.

\end{figure}


We first illustrate the LOWESS algorithm on a synthetic 3-year deformation time series with a 12-day acquisition interval (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-demo-data}).
%A 300 x 300 pixel region contains an uplift bowl which linearly increases to $ \sim3 $cm max after 1.5 years (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-demo-data}a) and deflates back to zero by the end of 3 years. 
The true deformation simulates uplift which linearly increases to $ \sim3 $cm max after 1.5 years and deflates back to zero by the end of 3 years. 
Turbulent tropospheric noise is simulated following \cite{Hanssen2001RadarInterferometryData} and added to the deformation.
% (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-demo-data}b). 
%The uplift bowl inflates at a constant rate for 1.5 years, then deflates back to 0 by the end of the 3rd year (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-demo-data}c).
To emulate the output from an SBAS inversion, the time series is shifted by the noise on the first day so that $ \phi_0 = 0 $.

\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-demo} illustrates two iterations of the LOWESS algorithm the $ \bm{\phi} $ time series.
During the first iteration, each $ \hat{\phi}_i $ is calculated using a locally weighted regression with the weight based solely on the proximity to $ t_i $ (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-demo}a). The resulting fit tracks the general pattern of the data, but outlier points strongly influence the fit (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-demo}b). 
%Using the residuals of the fit from Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-demo}b, 
The second iteration multiplies the proximity weighting from Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-demo}a by the residual weighting, $ \bm{\delta} $, calculated from the previous iteration (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-demo}c).
The second iteration is influenced less by the outlier points and has fewer spurious bumps in the time series (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-algo-demo}d). In general, more iterations may be performed; in this example, further iterations change the fit by $ \sim $ 1 mm or less.

After subtracting $ \phi_0 $ from all points, the results of the LOWESS estimate $ \bm{\hat{\phi}} $ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch5-compare-tri} (green line). The LOWESS algorithm smooths away the large spikes of turbulence noise in  $ \bm{\phi} $ (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-compare-tri}, blue) and captures most of the deformation signal (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-compare-tri}, orange)
%We note that since the width of the weighting window $ \bm{w} $ was slightly over 1 year, the algorithm smooths over the peak of the deformation lasting several months (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-compare-tri}a, orange line),
%The LOWESS solution captures most of the deformation signal (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-compare-tri}c), missing only the sharp peak due to the 1.2 year weighting window.
For comparison, we have also linearly filtered the noisy time series with triangle filter of width 1.2 years (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-compare-tri} pink line). 
The triangle filter performs similarly to LOWESS when the noise is Gaussian; however, the large turbulence jumps in this example cause the triangle filter to be pulled $>2$ cm away from the true deformation time series.





\section{7-year Sentinel-1 cumulative surface deformation}

We demonstrate the LOWESS algorithm on real Sentinel-1 data over the Permian Basin.
We processed an additional three years of data (Jan. 2019 though Dec. 2021) for Path 78 (Figure \ref{fig:paper1-study-area}) following the processing strategy outlined in Section \ref{sec:ch3-insar-processing}, for a total of 151 SAR acquisitions from Nov. 2014 to Dec. 2021
We performed an unregularized SBAS inversion to get a noisy time series $ \bm{\phi} $ for each pixel. 
To mitigate residual long wavelength noise from seasonal tropospheric patterns, we fit and removed a quadratic surface from the deformation map at each SAR acquisition using pixels with $<$2 cm of estimated deformation \citep{Morishita2020LicsbasOpenSource}. We then temporally smoothed each pixel's using the LOWESS algorithm with a weighting window covering $\geq 2$ years at all time intervals and 2 robust iterations. We similarly processed 147 descending Path 85 SAR acquisitions to create a 7-year cumulative LOS deformation time series.

% sampled every 6 months.
We also processed 148 SAR acquisitions from ascending Path 151 SAR (west of Path 85) to cover the full Delaware Basin with at least $2$ paths of data in all location.
The Path 151 footprint does not contain GPS station TXKM that was used as the reference location for the other paths;
%therefore, or any other GPS station near the center of the footprint, 
instead, we used the technique presented in \cite{Zebker2021AccuracyModelFree} to fit and remove a phase-elevation trend from all high-coherence pixels in each interferogram and zero-reference the deformation. This method works well for interferograms covering large regions where only a subset of high-coherence pixels contain significant deformation.
%. which is true for Path 151 which only partially overlaps with the Permian Basin's production region.


\subsection{LOS deformation results}
\label{sec:ch5-results-path78}


To assess the performance of the LOWESS-smoothed LOS deformation results, we projected the available GPS ENU time series onto the radar LOS. 
As an example, Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-gps-example}a shows the LOS time series (blue dots) for GPS station TXFS, along with its 30-day moving average (orange line).
The unregularized InSAR time series (gray) contains up to 5-7 cm of tropospheric noise during the summer months. However, the LOWESS solution (green line) is unaffected by the spikes and successfully tracks the $ \sim1 $cm of long term motion shown in the GPS data. 
In Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-gps-example}b, the LOS time series for GPS station TXSO shows a combination of a 5-10 mm increase in LOS along with 10-15 mm of seasonal variations.
While the trend is captured by the InSAR LOWESS solution, the seasonal variations are smoothed over due to the $2$ year weighting window.

\end{figure}


The full set of GPS comparisons for Path 78 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-gps}. 
The additional 3 years of Sentinel-1 data allow for an additional two station comparisons (at TXM5, TXB8) for a total of 15 stations within the Path 78 footprint.
There is an average of 5 mm RMS difference between the smoothed GPS time series and the InSAR LOWESS solutions for all time steps across the 15 stations, and a maximum absolute difference of 1.5 cm at any time point (including seasonal variations).

%TODO: discuss the end point variance? largest uncertainty for the final 6-12 months?

While many spatial patterns present in the map are also visible in the 4-year deformation map (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-insar-los}), there are several notable deformation rate changes between the 2015-2018 period and the 2019-2021 period.
For example, near the SWD wells identified in \cite{Kim2018AssociationLocalizedGeohazards} (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-path78-examples}a), there was steady surface uplift as injection volume increased from 2015-2018. After the injection well near the uplift peak (Well 2) shut down operations after 2018, there was a gradual deflation for the next three years (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-path78-examples}b).
In the northern Delaware Basin, many of the subsidence patterns present in the 4-year cumulative maps show accelerating rates of subsidence as oil production volumes increased through 2020.
One example subsidence bowl on the New Mexico side of the TX-NM border (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-path78-examples}c) subsided 4-5 cm for the four years of 2015-2018. As both oil and water production increased in the surrounding wells, the subsidence rate increased to $ >5 $ cm per year.

%\subsection{Vertical Deformation}

The cumulative LOS deformation from Nov. 2014 to Dec. 2021 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-los-paths-85-151} for Path 151 (panel (a)), and Path 85 (panel (b)).
In addition to the LOS decomposition using Paths 78 and 85 described in Section \ref{sec:ch4-insar-decomp}, we performed a second LOS decomposition using Paths 85 and 151.
We merged the two decompositions by averaging their region of overlap, and we cropped the maps to the western contour of the Delaware Basin to obtain continuous vertical (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-east-up}a) and eastward (Figure \ref{fig:ch5-results-east-up}b) deformation solutions.
