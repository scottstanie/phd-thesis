\label{CHAP:4-GRL}

%In this chapter,  we present a simple yet effective time series method for creating cumulative surface deformation maps over large regions with severe tropospheric noise. We use the method to create yearly deformation maps over the oil-producing region of the Permian Basin. The method incorporates an automated outlier detection and removal algorithm, which enabled ~2 mm/year agreement with GPS measurements in the presence of $\sim$15 cm of tropospheric noise.


Previous InSAR studies have demonstrated the use of surface deformation data for understanding causes of induced seismicity; however, these studies focused on study areas $ \sim $ 60-by-60 km or smaller. 
%Basin-wide InSAR surface deformation data with detailed uncertainty quantification are needed for assessing the likelihood of induced seismicity risk in the Permian Basin. 
Since InSAR tropospheric noise variance increases with the distance away from the reference point, it is difficult to expand the InSAR spatial coverage to the entire Permian Basin while retaining millimeter level accuracy.

%Within Texas, \cite{Shirzaei2016SurfaceUpliftTime} reported indications of surface uplift due to wastewater injection near a 2012 M4.8 earthquake, though limited validation for the ALOS data was available at this site near Timpson, TX \citep{Semple2017IncompleteInventorySuspected}. \cite{Kim2018AssociationLocalizedGeohazards} detected multiple deformation bowls within the Delaware Basin related to wastewater injection, $CO_2$ injection, and hydrocarbon production using Sentinel-1 InSAR data. \cite{Zheng2019WastewaterLeakageWest} incorporated InSAR-derived surface deformation data into a poroelastic model to analyze the geomechanical processes near an uplift signal in northern West Texas. They discovered that the observed surface deformation was likely caused by injection well leakages, rather than pressure increases at the planned injection depth, and the leaks may have contributed to freshwater contamination. More recently, \cite{Deng2020SurfaceDeformationInduced} used ascending Sentinel-1 LOS measurements to infer pore pressure change and Coulomb failure stress change at three sites in the southern Delaware Basin. They suggested that certain groups of earthquakes are likely induced by fluid injection, but noted that local rock structure and media properties are key controls on the area's susceptibility to induced seismicity.

%Previous InSAR studies demonstrated the use of InSAR surface deformation data for understanding causes of induced seismicity; however, these studies only focused on study areas $ \sim $ 60-by-60km or smaller, and basin-wide InSAR surface deformation data with detailed uncertainty quantification are needed for assessing the likelihood of induced seismicity risk. Since InSAR tropospheric noise variance increases with the distance away from the reference point \citep{Emardson2003NeutralAtmosphericDelay}, it is difficult to expand the InSAR spatial coverage to the entire Permian basin while retaining millimeter level accuracy. 

%In this chapter, we show that the increasing quantity and quality of Sentinel-1 SAR data allows us to average thousands of interferograms and mitigate strong tropospheric noise. We developed an outlier detection algorithm that removes InSAR measurements corrupted by severe tropospheric noise (e.g. storms and heat waves) and reduces InSAR measurement uncertainty by another factor of 2, down to 1-3 mm/year across the basin. Our results were validated by independent GPS measurements recorded at 13 permanent ground stations. 
%The InSAR-observed subsidence patterns over the Pecos area can be modeled as dip-slip over multiple normal faults and discretized cylindrical reservoir compaction. 
%Our InSAR deformation maps are now available through the Center for Integrated Seismicity Research (CISR) for the broader scientific community. 
%This dataset, when combined with physics-based reservoir and fault modeling, can produce insights into the causes of induced seismicity. 
%Furthermore, these surface deformation data products can be used to assess the areal effectiveness of the oil and gas production, a measure for estimating which regions of a reservoir are being depleted most quickly. InSAR techniques now provide a low-cost method to assist oil and gas operations and risk management at a basin-scale.

\section{Algorithms}


\subsection{Stacking and InSAR time series analysis}
\label{sec:ch4-method-compare}
%[Method only, define equations and formulas. This already outlines how we solve for deformation]

To investigate how InSAR measurement noise influences the LOS deformation solutions, we compared the results derived from (1) the stacking method, (2) an SBAS linear deformation (constant velocity) model with $L_1$ and $L_2$-norm penalty functions, and (3) unregularized and regularized SBAS deformation time series. 
We assume there are $M$ small-baseline interferograms that were generated from $N$ SAR scenes acquired over a period of interest. 
%The stacking method from \cite{Sandwell1998PhaseGradientApproach} solves for the average velocity over the study period. 
%An interferogram measures surface deformation that occurred between the two SAR acquisition times along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction \citep{Hanssen2001RadarInterferometryData}.
We employed a stacking approach \citep{Sandwell1998PhaseGradientApproach} to calculate the average LOS velocity $v_{avg}$ of each ground pixel over a time period of interest $T$ as:
\begin{equation}
	v_{avg} = \frac{\sum_{i \in G} \bm{\Delta  d_i}}{\sum_{i \in G} \bm{\Delta t}_i}
	\label{eq:ch4-stacking}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is a subset of interferograms that were formed using two SAR scenes acquired within the time period $T$. The LOS measurement (in cm) and the temporal baseline of the $i^{th}$ interferogram in $G$ are written as $  \bm{\Delta  d_i} $ and $ \bm{\Delta t}_i $ respectively. 
%In Section \ref{sec:ch4-method-compare}, we show that comparable LOS velocity estimates can be produced using the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) approach \citep{Berardino2002NewAlgorithmSurface} with a constant velocity (linear deformation) model.


Similarly, the SBAS method outlined in Section \ref{sec:ch2-insar-ts} can be augmented with a linear deformation model.
In this formulation, we solve for the average velocity $ v_{avg} $ over this period at each pixel of interest as \citep{Berardino2002NewAlgorithmSurface}:
\begin{equation}
	\arg \min_{v_{avg}} \norm{ \bm{BP} v_{avg} - \bm{\Delta d}   }_p
	\label{eq:ch4-sbas-linear}
\end{equation}
where $ \bm{B }$ is the $ M \times (N-1) $ SBAS matrix, $ \bm{P}$ is an $ (N-1) \times 1 $ vector of ones, $ \bm{\Delta d} $ is the $ M \times 1 $ vector of LOS measurements (in cm) at this pixel, and $ p \in \{1, 2\} $ is the norm used to penalize the data misfit. The $L_2$ linear deformation solution is comparable to the stacking solution (with an assumption of a constant velocity), and the $L_1$ solution is typically less sensitive to measurement outliers than the $L_2$ solution.

The LOS surface velocities between adjacent SAR acquisitions $ \bm{v} = \left[v_1 , \ldots , v_{N-1} \right]^T $ can be solved as:
\begin{equation}
	\arg \min_{\bm{v} } \norm{ \bm{Bv} - \bm{\Delta d}   }^2_2 + \alpha \norm{ \bm{Dv} }^2_2  \label{eq:ch4-sbas}
\end{equation}
where $ \bm{D} $ is a $ (N-2) \times (N-1) $ matrix, with $1$ on the main diagonal and $-1$ on the superdiagonal, which approximates the first-order differentiation operator. The first term penalizes the data misfit, the second term is a temporal smoothness constraint, and $ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} $ is the weight between the two terms. When $ \alpha = 0 $, the solution is the unregularized SBAS deformation time series. An additional integration of $\mathbf{v}$ over time yields the LOS deformation time series.

%where $G$ is a subset of interferograms that were formed using two SAR scenes acquired within the time period $T$.

\subsection{Tropospheric noise outlier removal}
\label{sec:ch4-outlier-method}

We examined interferograms at the 13 control locations and discovered that non-Gaussian tails (outliers) are present. For example, LOS measurements of the ascending interferograms at pixels near the GPS station TXMC show a near zero median (-4 mm) and a standard deviation of 3.2 cm (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-outliers} (a)). Due to the absence of substantial deformation signal at this station, the standard deviation of the LOS distribution is a measure of turbulent tropospheric noise.  We found that the median LOS turbulent error is close to zero (no systematic noise bias) at all GPS control stations. The standard deviation of the turbulent noise increases as the square root of the distance from the InSAR reference point (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-outliers} (b)). Furthermore, we compared the LOS turbulent noise distribution observed at each GPS station to a normal distribution using a normal probability plot \citep{Filliben1975ProbabilityPlotCorrelation}. We discovered that non-Gaussian tails (outliers) are present (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:ch4-outliers}(c)) as a result of severe tropospheric noise (e.g. storms or heat waves).

	\label{fig:ch4-outliers}
\end{figure}



%When severe tropospheric noise (e.g. storms or heat waves) affects interferograms, the resulting measurement distribution at a given pixel can contain large non-Gaussian tails. 
%Identifying and removing InSAR measurement outliers is crucial for achieving millimeter level accuracy. 
Because severe tropospheric noise may only impact a portion of a SAR image, we identified InSAR measurement outliers at each pixel independently as follows. Given $N$ SAR acquisitions, there are up to $N-1$ InSAR LOS measurements at a pixel of interest that contain the common tropospheric noise of the $k^{th}$ SAR scene. We defined $u_{k,n}$ as the $n^{th}$ such LOS measurement, and $\bar{u}_k$ as the mean absolute measurement:
\begin{equation}
	\bar{u}_k  = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} |u_{k,n}|  
\end{equation}
We labeled $u_{k,n}$ (for all $n$) as outlier measurements if $\bar{u}_k > \mathrm{median}(\mathbf{\bar{u}}) + 4 \sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}$, where $\mathbf{\bar{u}}=[\bar{u}_1,...,\bar{u}_N]$, and $\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=1.483 \cdot \mathrm{MAD}(\mathbf{\bar{u}})$. Here we employed a robust statistics measure, the median absolute deviation (MAD), for estimating the spread of data samples in the presence of outliers \citep{Hampel1974InfluenceCurveIts, Rousseeuw2011RobustStatisticsOutlier}. Given a vector $\mathbf{x}$ that contains $M$ data samples, $\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{MAD}(\mathbf{x}) =  \underset{m = 1,\ldots M}{\mathrm{median}} \left( \bigr\lvert  x_m - \mathrm{median}(\mathbf{x})  \bigr\rvert \right)
\end{equation}
where $x_m$ is the $m^{th}$ data sample. 



%To account for the large variation in look angle within one Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) swath image, we used the LOS unit vector at each pixel location Figure \ref{fig:los-map})) in the LOS decomposition.





%In this study, used the Sentinel-1 interferograms from path 78 and path 85 processed as described in Section \ref{sec:ch2-insar-processing}.
%We solved for the average LOS velocities over three periods of interest: Nov. 2014 to Jan. 2017, Nov. 2014 to Jan. 2018, and Nov. 2014 to Jan. 2019. Over each time period $T_j$, we computed the cumulative LOS surface deformation as the product of $v_{avg,j}$ and $T_j$. We also solved for the vertical and eastward deformation in the region where path 78 and 85 overlap (see Section \ref{sec:ch2-insar-decomp}) using the LOS unit vector at each pixel location Figure \ref{fig:los-map})) in the LOS decomposition.

	}
	\label{fig:los-map}
\end{figure}

An interferogram measures surface deformation between the two SAR acquisition times along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction. The LOS deformation, $u_{LOS}$, can be written as: 
\begin{align}
	u_{LOS}= \alpha_{e} u_{e} + \alpha_{n} u_{n} + \alpha_{u} u_{u}
\end{align}
where $u_{e}$, $u_{n}$ and $u_{u}$ are the east, north and up displacements, respectively. The radar look vector $\alpha = [\alpha_e, \alpha_n, \alpha_u]$ can be calculated from the known imaging geometry at every pixel location. This varies significantly for Sentinel-1 due to the $ \sim$250 km wide swath (Figure \ref{fig:los-map}). 


In regions where InSAR data are available from two LOS directions, we can decompose the ground motion into its eastward and vertical components.
To perform the decomposition, we first write $u_{asc}$ and $u_{desc}$ in terms of $u_e$, $u_n$ and $u_u$:
\begin{align}
	u_{asc} &= \alpha_{a,e} u_{e} + \alpha_{a,n} u_{n} + \alpha_{a,u} u_{u}\\
	u_{desc} &= \alpha_{d,e} u_{e} + \alpha_{d,n} u_{n} + \alpha_{d,u} u_{u}
\end{align}
We can express $u_e$ and $u_u$ as:
\begin{align}
	u_{e} &\approx  \frac{1}{\beta}  \left[\alpha_{d,u}  u_{asc} - \alpha_{a,u} u_{desc} \right] \\
	u_{u} &\approx  \frac{1}{\beta}  \left[\alpha_{a,e} u_{desc} - \alpha_{d,e}  u_{asc}  \right] 
\end{align}
where  $ \beta = {\alpha_{a,e} \alpha_{d,u}- \alpha_{d,e} \alpha_{a,u}} $.

		(top) Ascending and descending line-of-sight cumulative deformation between November 2014 and April 2017. Red indicates motion toward each satellite.
		(bottom) Cumulative vertical and horizontal surface deformation due to wastewater injection in Winkler County, TX. The horizontal motion here is $\sim$ 20\% of the vertical motion, with up to $\sim$ 5.5 cm of uplift and $\sim$ 1.2 cm of east-west motion. This localized deformation feature was originally reported in \cite{Kim2018AssociationLocalizedGeohazards}.}
	\label{fig:ch2-injection-kim-lu}
\end{figure}



Because Sentinel-1 satellites are operating in a near-polar orbit, the north look coefficients $\alpha_{a,n}$ and $\alpha_{d,n}$ are both relatively small. Ignoring 1 cm northward motion in $u_n$ only leads to $\sim$ 0.1-0.2 mm error in $u_e$ and $\sim$ 1 mm error in $u_u$ at most locations. 

To illustrate a decomposition, Figure \ref{fig:ch2-injection-kim-lu} shows a 12 km x 12 km region centered on a wastewater injection well found by \cite{Kim2018AssociationLocalizedGeohazards} to show injection-related uplift. We observe similar magnitude deformation toward the satellite in both ascending and descending tracks (Figure \ref{fig:ch2-injection-kim-lu} top). After decomposing the two geometries using the LOS vector at each pixel, we observed $\sim$ 5.5 cm of uplift and $\sim$1.2 cm of east-west motion between November 2014 and April 2017 (Figure \ref{fig:ch2-injection-kim-lu} bottom). 

% ORIGINAL:  \cite{Kim2018AssociationLocalizedGeohazards} detected several localized deformation features within the Delaware Basin related to wastewater injection, CO2 injection, and hydrocarbon production using Sentinel-1 InSAR data.  Our LOS decomposition results are consistent with their study at these locations. For example, in a 12 km x 12 km region centered on a wastewater injection well, we observed $\sim$ 5.5 cm of uplift and $\sim$1.2 cm of east-west motion between November 2014 and April 2017 (Figure \ref{fig:injection-kim-lu}). 



%\subsection{Uncertainty Propagation through LOS decomposition}
%\label{sec:ch2-decomp-uq-prop}
%Since the LOS decomposition is a linear operation, given two LOS uncertainties, we can use linear uncertainty propagation theory to determine the vertical/horizontal uncertainties.

%- Bottom half of outlier figure showing the visible artifacts removed
%- Talk about the time series comparison figure, how each had problems, then after outlier removal most converge (+ table quantifying the before/after)
%- conclude all methods converge and we use a simple stacking with outlier removal to calculate cumulative deformation.
%





Using the 13 GPS east, north, and up time series as ground truth, we quantified the errors in the InSAR stacking solutions before and after the outlier removal. 
%There are 13 permanent GPS stations in the ascending SAR footprint.
At each GPS location, we projected the GPS time series to the radar line-of-sight (LOS), and we computed the GPS-inferred average LOS velocity through a linear regression. Table \ref{tab:gps-error-78} shows the root mean square (RMS) and the worst-case absolute differences between InSAR and GPS inferred average LOS velocities over the three study periods. Similarly, there are 5 permanent GPS stations in the descending SAR footprint, and Table \ref{tab:gps-error-85} shows the uncertainty in the descending stacking solutions using these 5 GPS stations as control. Both Table \ref{tab:gps-error-78} and Table \ref{tab:gps-error-85} show that our outlier removal algorithm reduced the uncertainty in InSAR stacking solutions by a factor of $\sim$2, down to 1-3 mm/year across the basin. For a given period of interest $T_j$, the LOS velocity error $ E_{vel,j} $ propagates into the cumulative deformation error $ E_{c, j} $ as $ E_{c,j} = E_{vel,j} \cdot T_j $.

%To evaluate the performance of our InSAR processing strategy, 
We projected GPS data recorded at 13 control stations onto the LOS directions to use as ground truth. The differences between InSAR and GPS inferred average LOS velocities were used as a measure of the uncertainty in the InSAR surface deformation solutions. 
We found that stacking reduces the impact of random Gaussian turbulent noise by $ \sim \sqrt{N} $, where $ N $ is the number of SAR acquisitions. The outlier removal algorithm further reduces the uncertainty in the LOS velocity estimates by a factor of 2, down to 1-3 mm/year across the basin. For example, the average InSAR velocity along the ascending LOS direction between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2018 shows a root mean square (RMS) error of 3.4 mm/year before the outlier removal, and 1.5 mm/year after the outlier removal. The presence of InSAR measurement outliers resulted in long-wavelength artifacts ($ \sim $100km and greater) in the cumulative deformation solutions (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:ch4-outliers} (d)), which were automatically mitigated through the pixel-based outlier removal algorithm (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:ch4-outliers} (e)). Additionally, we compared InSAR LOS deformation solutions as derived from (1) the stacking method, (2) a SBAS linear deformation model with $L_1$ and $L_2$-norm penalty functions, and (3) unregularized and regularized SBAS deformation time series (Section \ref{sec:ch4-method-compare}). These InSAR time series algorithms can be implemented using software packages such as Generic InSAR Analysis Toolbox (GIAnT) \citep{Agram2013NewRadarInterferometric}, STAMPS \citep{Hooper2012RecentAdvancesSar}, and LiCSBAS \citep{Morishita2020LicsbasOpenSource}. Removing the detected outliers leads to more accurate and consistent surface deformation solutions in all three cases. 



%Little surface deformation occurred between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2019 at the 13 GPS permanent GPS stations. 
At each GPS location, we projected the GPS time series to the radar line-of-sight (LOS), and we used the GPS-inferred average LOS velocity (0-3 mm/year) as ground truth. Table \ref{tab:compare-errors} shows the root mean square (RMS) and the worst-case absolute differences between InSAR and GPS inferred average LOS velocities between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2018 as derived from the four InSAR time series methods. We found that InSAR tropospheric noise has a strong influence on all the surface deformation solutions before removing the measurement outliers. As an example, Figure \ref{fig:ch4-compare-ts} (a) shows the ascending LOS solutions between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2018 at the GPS station TXSO before removing InSAR measurement outliers. The random tropospheric noise creates up to $\sim$6 cm of error in the unregularized SBAS surface deformation time series. This error can be reduced by increasing $ \alpha$ in Equation \eqref{eq:ch4-sbas}. As $\alpha$ increases, the LOS deformation time series converge to the $L_2$ linear deformation (constant velocity) solution. However, there are visible cm-level tropospheric artifacts in the cumulative deformation solutions by using either $L_1$ or $L_2$ linear deformation models (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:ch4-outliers}(d)).   



After removing InSAR outlier measurements associated with extreme local weather events (Section \ref{sec:ch4-method-compare}), all SBAS time series methods produce more accurate and consistent deformation trends (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-compare-ts} (b)). The unregularized SBAS time series still contain up to $\sim$3 cm of tropospheric noise, which leads to long-wavelength artifacts in the basin-wide deformation maps. The $ L_1 $ and $ L_2 $ linear deformation solutions show close agreement ($<$ 2 mm difference) at all GPS stations. Since both methods suggest a deformation trend consistent with the stacking approach, we chose the simple stacking method as the final processing strategy for estimating cumulative surface deformation in the Permian Basin.

\section{Surface deformation in the Permian Basin}
The Sentinel-1 cumulative LOS deformation solutions reveal numerous surface deformation features over the oil-producing region in the Permian Basin (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-insar-los}). From the ascending geometry, we observed no substantial deformation in the Central Basin Platform, where oil and gas are mostly produced from conventional reservoirs. In the Midland and Delaware Basins, we observed an accelerating surface deformation rate between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2019, which coincides with the sharp rise of oil production from unconventional reservoirs in 2017 and 2018. For example, a 30 km$^2 $ area northwest of Pecos shows approximately 0.5 cm cumulative LOS deformation between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2017, 1.5 cm between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2018, and over 5.5 cm from Nov. 2014 to Jan. 2019. The greatest number of observable signals are present in 2018 when peak production occurred in the region. Similarly, from the descending geometry, we find no substantial deformation in the Central Basin Platform and an increasing rate of surface deformation in the Delaware Basin.

In the northern Delaware Basin, where large volumes of oil production and wastewater disposal occurred, the ascending and descending LOS deformation patterns are similar. This means that the observed deformation in this region is primarily vertical (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-insar-decomp} (b) and (e)). The observed subsidence or uplift features between Nov. 2014 and Jan. 2019 are $\sim$ 1-4 cm. In the southern Delaware Basin, \cite{Deng2020SurfaceDeformationInduced} solved for the cumulative LOS surface deformation between Nov. 2014 and Feb. 2019 ($\sim$ 100 km by 60 km) using the ascending Sentinel-1 data (path 78 frames 99-100). In this study, we found that the observed magnitudes of the ascending and descending LOS deformation are different (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-insar-los}), which suggests that both horizontal and vertical deformation occurred in this region. Previous studies near Mesquite, Nevada have shown that confined aquifer pumping in the presence of faults can produce complex asymmetrical deformation patterns with a non-trivial horizontal component \citep{Burbey2008InfluenceGeologicStructures}. In the Pecos area, the largest subsidence patterns ($\sim$ 13 cm over 4 years) occurred $\sim$ 15 km south of Pecos, and the largest eastward motion ($\sim$ 3-4 cm over 4 years) occurred near the town of Pecos along a line transect (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-insar-decomp} (c) and (f)). The observed linear deformation patterns parallel the inferred favorable fault plane orientation (a strike angle $\sim$ 300 degree lining up with the measured $S_{Hmax}$ direction) proposed by \cite{LundSnee2018StateStressPermian}, and they also align with a cluster of recent shallow earthquakes ($<$ 3 km depth) cataloged by TexNet.

\section{Implications for geomechanical modeling}
Based on fault plane solutions derived from recent seismic activity and the faulting stress regime interpretations \citep{LundSnee2018StateStressPermian}, the Pecos area is in a normal faulting regime. We employed an elastic dislocation model \citep{Okada1992InternalDeformationDue} to demonstrate that the presence of dip-slip normal faults can produce the observed linear subsidence patterns in this area (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-model} (a)). We solved for the dip angle, depth, width along the dip direction, and slip magnitude of four normal faults by best fitting the forward model to InSAR vertical deformation observations, minimizing the sum of squared residuals, and maximizing the r-squared values \citep{Du1992ComparisonVariousInversion} (Appendix \ref{appen:okada}). The optimal solution suggests that the depth of the faults ranges from 0.9 km to 1.5 km, which is shallower than most of the TexNet recorded earthquakes (2-6 km in depth). Possible explanations for this discrepancy include: (1) the existence of aseismic fault slippage being responsible for the observed surface deformation \citep{McGarr2017WastewaterDisposalEarthquake}; (2) bias in earthquake depth estimation in the TexNet catalog \citep{Lomax2019ImprovingAbsoluteEarthquake}; (3) systematic modeling errors associated with representing a mechanically layered earth as a homogeneous half space \citep{Du1992ComparisonVariousInversion}.

After removing the best-fit deformation associated with dip-slip faulting (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-model} (b)), there is still $\sim$ 2 cm residual subsidence in the Pecos area (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:ch4-model} (f)). Given that shallow groundwater production was minimal in this region for the time period of interest \citep{Deng2020SurfaceDeformationInduced}, we introduced an elastic reservoir compaction model \cite{Geertsma1973LandSubsidenceCompacting} to our geomechanical analysis (Appendix \ref{appen:model-compact}). We implemented two layers of multiple cylindrical reservoirs corresponding to reported locations and depths of well clusters in the Delaware Mountain Group (DMG) and Wolfcamp reservoirs, which account for most of the recent oil and gas production in the region. We discretized the DMG layer based on a cluster of production wells predominantly perforated over a depth range of 1.5-1.8 km. The Wolfcamp wells are completed over a depth range of 3-3.6 km. We employed an objective function inversion method to solve for the reservoir pressure depletion pattern that best fit the InSAR-observed subsidence (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-model} (c)) \citep{Du2001PoroelasticReservoirModel}.

An important conclusion of this study is that both fault slip and reservoir inflation or compaction can produce observable surface deformation over an 80,000 square kilometer oil-producing region of the Permian Basin. The InSAR-observed subsidence patterns over the Pecos area can be modeled as slip over multiple faults and discretized cylindrical reservoir compaction (Figure \ref{fig:ch4-model} (d)-(f)). We note that InSAR subsidence data alone can constrain all pertinent fault and reservoir parameters in our normal faulting and reservoir compaction models. The InSAR observed cumulative surface deformation patterns, which show larger horizontal component than the model prediction, suggest that other factors, such as strike-slip faulting and heterogeneity in subsurface properties, may play a role. There have been extensive studies on how reservoir compaction and inflation as well as fault slippage alter stress fields in the subsurface and produce surface deformation \citep{Geertsma1973LandSubsidenceCompacting,Segall1992InducedStressesDue,Okada1992InternalDeformationDue,Du1992ComparisonVariousInversion,Vasco2005UseQuasiStatic,Vasco2008ReservoirMonitoringCharacterization,Khakim2012GeomechanicalModelingInsar}. InSAR surface deformation can be combined with this knowledge to evaluate fluid recovery efficiency and monitor disposal wells at low cost. Furthermore, these high-quality geodetic measurements are readily available to complement the TexNet seismic catalog for assessing the likelihood of fault motion and induced earthquake risks in Texas.
