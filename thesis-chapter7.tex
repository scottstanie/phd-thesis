\label{CHAP:7}

In this thesis, we showed...

%Future conclusions- 
%ch5, seasonal lack. Maybe something about large scale filtering for knowing what you can get rid of? From modeling, converting defo to pore pressures, determining east motion. 
% ch5: modeling causes. proportion of aseismic slip (cite karissa,eyre,)
%Ch 6-  1. Turb is dominant. 2. No stratified. 3. Decorr to further resample and get uncertainty. 4. Resampling in a way to mimic the seasonal variations, rather than mean. 


% From Agnew, 1992
%it should be noted that the PSD description is not in general a complete specification of a process; the power spectrum is only a summary of second moments (variance versus frequency). Stochastic processes with identical power spectra can have very different appearances in the time domain

% Estimation of errors from decorr, from fading signal bias (yujies paper?), from aliasing effect (cite karissa) and phase unwrapping errors (cite yunjun), and from speckle induced errors (Zwiebeck)
