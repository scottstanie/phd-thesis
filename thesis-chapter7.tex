\label{CHAP:7}

In this thesis, we demonstrated the ability to derive accurate surface deformation maps over broad areas from InSAR measurements corrupted by severe tropospheric noise. We further demonstrated techniques for estimating uncertainty of automatically detected deformation features. Specifically, we have made the following contributions:


\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item We developed Python-based InSAR time series analysis software to ingest geocoded SAR images, extract surface deformation, decompose multiple geometries into horizontal and vertical deformation, and verify results with permanent GPS stations.
	
	\item We performed a rigorous uncertainty analysis to identify the dominant noise source in the Permian Basin for Sentinel-1.  In the process, we developed a method to estimate the tropospheric noise and its power spectral density from InSAR data.
	
	\item We designed scalable, robust time series algorithms for tracking yearly changes of deformation over large regions.
	
	\item We created millimeter-level accurate maps of cumulative surface deformation that are available online for analysis. These maps contain many subsidence and uplift features near oil and gas production, as well as linear patterns near clusters of seismic activity.
	
	\item We created a computer vision algorithm to automatically detect surface deformation signals of unknown sizes in large InSAR maps. The detection algorithm produces uncertainty estimates for each visual feature in the InSAR data.
	
		
\end{enumerate}

With multiple government and commercial SAR missions scheduled in upcoming years, there will be opportunities for creating continental and global deformation products from InSAR data.
For example, the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project at NASA JPL has been tasked to produce a North America land-surface displacement product from Sentinel-1 and NISAR data
\citep{Bekaert2021IntroducingOperaProject}.
%The processing and analysis techniques 
Since the processing and analysis techniques required for such products must be scalable and robust, the techniques developed in this thesis can contribute to these efforts.

Future work beyond extending the results presented here may include:

\begin{itemize}

%Future conclusions- 
%ch5, seasonal lack. Maybe something about large scale filtering for knowing what you can get rid of? From modeling, converting defo to pore pressures, determining east motion. 
% ch5: modeling causes. proportion of aseismic slip (cite karissa,eyre,)
%Ch 6-  1. Turb is dominant. 2. No stratified. 3. Decorr to further resample and get uncertainty. 4. Resampling in a way to mimic the seasonal variations, rather than mean. 

%\item Geomechanical modeling of the time-varying deformation maps over the Permian Basin. As Figure \ref{fig:ch5-discuss-eqs} suggests, 

\item Combining subsurface pore pressure models using the wastewater disposal history (e.g. \cite{Ge2022RecentWaterDisposal}) with the recent changes to surface deformation to determine subsurface flow barriers and locations of elevated pressure. This effort could leverage the recent detailed compilation of known faults in the Delaware Basin \citep{Horne2021BasementRootedFaults}.

% From Agnew, 1992
%it should be noted that the PSD description is not in general a complete specification of a process; the power spectrum is only a summary of second moments (variance versus frequency). Stochastic processes with identical power spectra can have very different appearances in the time domain


\item Simulating both seasonal and stratified tropospheric noise to more accurately estimate uncertainty. The noise simulations presented in Chapter \ref{CHAP:6-blob} used tropospheric turbulence, which was the dominant error source for West Texas. The seasonal variations of tropospheric noise may be important to accurately infer uncertainty for other study areas.
% or when using other time series analysis methods.

\item Incorporating additional error sources into the noise simulations, including unwrapping errors \citep{Yunjun2019SmallBaselineInsar}, closure phase bias \citep{Zheng2022ClosurePhaseSystematic}, and speckle-induced uncertainty \citep{Zwieback2022ReliableInsarPhase}. 
%Since difference study regions experience  a difference balance of phase errors from Equation \eqref{eq:ch2-insar-noise-terms} which need to be included for a reliable uncertainty estimate in the final time series.

\item Combining auxiliary data sources with the automatically detected deformation features of Chapter \ref{CHAP:6-blob} to classify/categorize possible causes of deformation.

\item Increasing accessibility of InSAR-derived products by leveraging new, cloud-friendly data formats (e.g. \cite{Kellndorfer2022GlobalSeasonalSentinel}).

% Estimation of errors from decorr, from fading signal bias (yujies paper?), from aliasing effect (cite karissa) and phase unwrapping errors (cite yunjun), and from speckle induced errors (Zwiebeck)
