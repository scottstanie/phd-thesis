\label{CHAP:7}

In this thesis, we showed...



\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item We developed Python-based InSAR time series analysis software to ingest geocoded SAR images, extract surface deformation, decompose multiple geometries into horizontal and vertical deformation, and verify results with permanent GPS stations.
	
	\item We performed a rigorous uncertainty analysis to identify the dominant noise source in the Permian Basin for Sentinel-1.  In the process, we developed a method to estimate the tropospheric noise and its power spectral density from InSAR data.
	
	\item We designed scalable, robust time series algorithms for tracking yearly changes of deformation over large regions.
	
	\item We created millimeter-level accurate maps of cumulative surface deformation that are available online for analysis. These maps contain many subsidence and uplift features near oil and gas production, as well as linear patterns near clusters of seismic activity.
	
	\item We created a computer vision algorithm to automatically detect surface deformation signals of unknown sizes in large InSAR maps. The detection algorithm produces uncertainty estimates for each visual feature in the InSAR data.

%Future conclusions- 
%ch5, seasonal lack. Maybe something about large scale filtering for knowing what you can get rid of? From modeling, converting defo to pore pressures, determining east motion. 
% ch5: modeling causes. proportion of aseismic slip (cite karissa,eyre,)
%Ch 6-  1. Turb is dominant. 2. No stratified. 3. Decorr to further resample and get uncertainty. 4. Resampling in a way to mimic the seasonal variations, rather than mean. 


% From Agnew, 1992
%it should be noted that the PSD description is not in general a complete specification of a process; the power spectrum is only a summary of second moments (variance versus frequency). Stochastic processes with identical power spectra can have very different appearances in the time domain

% Estimation of errors from decorr, from fading signal bias (yujies paper?), from aliasing effect (cite karissa) and phase unwrapping errors (cite yunjun), and from speckle induced errors (Zwiebeck)
