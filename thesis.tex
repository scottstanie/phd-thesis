Over the past decade, as the Permian Basin became the United States' largest producer of oil and gas, the region experienced a sharp rise in the number of earthquakes. 
%Injection or withdrawal of fluids from the subsurface can induce earthquakes along existing faults, and an increased rate of low magnitude earthquakes have been observed along with the increase in hydrocarbon production in West Texas. 
%While petroleum production and wastewater injection volumes have been rising throughout the basin, the recently cataloged earthquakes are spatially clustered. 
%One significant cluster is near Pecos, TX, where increased seismic activity began in 2009 and climbed to more than 2000 earthquakes in 2017. 
%To better understand the causes of these earthquakes and to assess the likelihood of infrastructure damage and safety concerns, knowledge of subsurface stress and pore pressure changes is needed. 
While subsurface measurements are expensive and difficult to obtain, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique which can measure deformation of Earth's surface over broad areas with 10-100 meter spatial resolution and millimeter-to-centimeter accuracy.
These measurements can be used to derive information about Earthâ€™s subsurface, estimate the distribution of fault slip, and infer associated seismic risk.
However, the noise sources of InSAR pose considerable challenges to achieving millimeter-level accuracy over large study areas, and automated and scalable algorithms are necessary to process and interpret the ever-growing volume of InSAR data 
%Previous InSAR induced seismicity studies have mostly focused on areas 60-by-60 km or smaller. Because InSAR tropospheric noise variance increases with the distance away from the reference point, it is difficult to expand the InSAR spatial coverage to the entire Permian basin while retaining millimeter level accuracy. 
Here we demonstrate the ability to measure subtle surface deformation features caused by petroleum production and induced earthquakes over the entire Permian Basin. 
A novel outlier detection technique is developed to detect measurements corrupted by >10 cm of turbulent tropospheric noise. 
We also present a robust time series smoothing technique for extracting nonlinear deformation in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.
%, as well as a robust 
Our deformation maps achieve basin-wide 1-3 mm/year accuracy as verified by available permanent GPS stations.
Furthermore, the recent growth in satellite data has created a need for automated and scalable algorithms for processing and interpreting large deformation maps.
%The final surface deformation products, which achieve basin-wide 1-3 mm/year accuracy, enable physics-based modeling of the subsurface processes that drive the induced seismicity. 
We develop a computer vision algorithm capable of detecting deformation features of unknown size and location in large deformation maps.
We combine this algorithm with a data-driven method for estimating tropospheric noise strength on individual SAR acquisitions to produce uncertainty measures for each automatically detected deformation feature.
The number of high-confidence detected deformation features increases substantially over the study period, which is consistent with the overall rise in oil production within the Permian Basin since 2014.
As the volume of publicly available SAR data continues to grow from future missions, will help realize InSAR's science potential for monitoring and understanding our changing planet.

%\significancestatement{Because energy-related injection and extraction activities often occur within deep and rigid subsurface formations, it is common to assume little deformation can be detected at Earth's surface. Here we use Sentinel-1 InSAR data to show that the sharp increase in oil and gas production from shale over the last five years has led to numerous surface deformation features in the Permian Basin. The prominent linear deformation streaks observed in the Pecos area can be explained by elastic modeling of combined fault slip and reservoir compaction. The location and orientation of these streaks align well with known shallow faults and recent earthquake clusters that are likely induced by injection or withdrawal of fluids from the subsurface.}

%Over the past decade, technological breakthroughs in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the Permian Basin one of the most prolific oil fields in the world. Here we used over 7000 Sentinel-1 interferograms (Nov. 2014 - Jan. 2019; 120-meter pixel spacing) to map how Earth's surface deformed in response to fluid injection and extraction in this region. We developed an automated InSAR outlier removal algorithm, which allows us to achieve $\sim$ 2 mm/year accuracy across the basin in the presence of up to $\pm$ 15 cm of noise related to tropospheric effects. We observed numerous subsidence and uplift bowls in the vicinity of active production and disposal wells. The rate of deformation increased significantly in 2018 when peak production occurred in the region. The most important deformation signatures are linear streaks that extend tens of kilometers near Pecos, TX, where a cluster of increased seismic events was catalogued by TexNet. Elastic modeling shows that fluid extraction and dip-slip along normal faults are the potential causes for the observed deformation patterns, which align well with known shallow faults in the area. The implication for the scientific community, as well as a broader sector of stakeholders, is that the large increase of usable spaceborne geodetic data has enabled basin-wide monitoring of subsurface stress and pore pressure changes in oil producing regions.
