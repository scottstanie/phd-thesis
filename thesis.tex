The Permian Basin has become the United States' largest producer of oil and gas over the past decade. During the same time, it has experienced a sharp rise in the number of induced earthquakes. In order to better understand the damage potential from induced earthquakes, new data and monitoring approaches are critical needed. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique that measures surface deformation over broad areas with 10s-100s meter spatial resolution and up to millimeter-to-centimeter accuracy. These measurements can be used to derive information about Earthâ€™s subsurface and assess induced seismic risks. However, it is difficult to perform basin-scale surface deformation mapping and automatic feature detection using InSAR, because the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the deformation signals compared to tropospheric noise is extremely low. It is common to assume that the Permian Basin is so rigid, and the subtle deformation associated with oil and gas production and waste water injection are not detectable by InSAR.

In this dissertation, we develop methods for characterizing tropospheric noise and its power spectral density directly from InSAR observations. We show that the tropospheric noise distribution is non-Gaussian, and a small portion of SAR scenes are corrupted by up to $\pm$ 15 cm noise outliers associated with storms and heat waves. This finding is significant, because most of the InSAR time series solutions are only optimal when noise follows a Gaussian distribution. We design robust and scalable time series algorithms to reconstruct the temporal evolution of surface deformation in this challenging scenario, and we achieved basin-wide millimeter-level accuracy based on independent GPS validation. We observe numerous subsidence and uplift features near active production and disposal wells, as well as linear deformation patterns associated with fault activities near clusters of induced earthquakes over the Pecos area. Furthermore, we designed  a new computer vision algorithm for detecting the size and location of unknown deformation features from a large volume of InSAR data. We are able to determine whether a detected feature is associated with tropospheric artifacts or real deformation signals based on a realistic tropospheric noise model derived from InSAR data.

% However, the noise sources of InSAR pose considerable challenges to achieving millimeter-level accuracy over large study areas, and automated, scalable algorithms are necessary to process and interpret the growing volume of InSAR data.  Here we demonstrate the ability to measure subtle surface deformation features caused by petroleum production and induced earthquakes over the entire Permian Basin.
% A rigorous analysis of all noise sources in the Sentinel-1 InSAR data identified tropospheric turbulence noise as the dominant noise term, and we developed methods for characterizing the tropospheric noise and its power spectral density directly from InSAR data. We designed scalable time series algorithms which are robust to troposphere noise outliers for reconstructing the temporal evolution of surface deformation over very wide regions. Based on independent validation from GPS permanent stations, our cumulative surface deformation solutions from 2014 - 2021 achieved millimeter-level accuracy.
% Furthermore, the recent growth in satellite data has created a need for automatically locating deformation signals of interest. We developed a computer vision algorithm capable of detecting deformation features of unknown size and location in large deformation maps. Combined with our tropospheric noise characterization, our algorithm produces uncertainty measures for each automatically detected deformation feature. We detected a growing number of high-confidence features as oil production rose across the basin, including numerous subsidence and uplift features near active production and disposal wells, as well as linear deformation patterns associated with fault slip near clusters of earthquakes.
%increases substantially over the study period, which is consistent with the overall rise in oil production within the Permian Basin since 2014.
% As the volume of publicly available SAR data continues to grow from future missions, the techniques developed here will help realize InSAR's full science potential for monitoring and understanding our changing planet.
%The final surface deformation products, which achieve basin-wide 1-3 mm/year accuracy, enable physics-based modeling of the subsurface processes that drive the induced seismicity. 
%InSAR reveals numerous subsidence and uplift features near active production and disposal wells, as well as linear deformation patterns associated with fault activities near clusters of seismic activity over the Pecos area.

%\significancestatement{Because energy-related injection and extraction activities often occur within deep and rigid subsurface formations, it is common to assume little deformation can be detected at Earth's surface. Here we use Sentinel-1 InSAR data to show that the sharp increase in oil and gas production from shale over the last five years has led to numerous surface deformation features in the Permian Basin. The prominent linear deformation streaks observed in the Pecos area can be explained by elastic modeling of combined fault slip and reservoir compaction. The location and orientation of these streaks align well with known shallow faults and recent earthquake clusters that are likely induced by injection or withdrawal of fluids from the subsurface.}

%Over the past decade, technological breakthroughs in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the Permian Basin one of the most prolific oil fields in the world. Here we used over 7000 Sentinel-1 interferograms (Nov. 2014 - Jan. 2019; 120-meter pixel spacing) to map how Earth's surface deformed in response to fluid injection and extraction in this region. We developed an automated InSAR outlier removal algorithm, which allows us to achieve $\sim$ 2 mm/year accuracy across the basin in the presence of up to $\pm$ 15 cm of noise related to tropospheric effects. We observed numerous subsidence and uplift bowls in the vicinity of active production and disposal wells. The rate of deformation increased significantly in 2018 when peak production occurred in the region. The most important deformation signatures are linear streaks that extend tens of kilometers near Pecos, TX, where a cluster of increased seismic events was catalogued by TexNet. Elastic modeling shows that fluid extraction and dip-slip along normal faults are the potential causes for the observed deformation patterns, which align well with known shallow faults in the area. The implication for the scientific community, as well as a broader sector of stakeholders, is that the large increase of usable spaceborne geodetic data has enabled basin-wide monitoring of subsurface stress and pore pressure changes in oil producing regions.
