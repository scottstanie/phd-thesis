Completing a Ph.D. requires a great support network, and I'm fortunate to have many people to thank.
First, I'd like to express sincere gratitude to my advisor, Ann Chen. 
Ann kept my academic and career growth in mind with every piece of guidance she gave, but she also always considered my personal well-being. I'm lucky to have been among the first of her students. She also has  built an outstanding research group: Sophy Wu, Ke Wang, and Molly Zebker. Our group meetings always led to my research presentations being greatly improved, and I couldn't have asked for a group of people more supportive, smart, helpful, and kind.

I'd like to thank my committee members, each of whom contributed to improving this dissertation. Prof. Srinivas Bettadpur and  Prof. Todd Humphreys offered excellent research questions and guidance, and they were also outstanding teachers for the classes that I took with them. Prof. Jon Olson and Dr. Peter Hennings were wonderful coauthors and gave me valuable perspective on the impact of my data.  I'd also like to thank my coauthors and collaborators at the Center for Integrated Seismicity Research and the Bureau for Economic Geology: Hunjoo Lee, Lily Horne, Katie Smye, Alexandros Savvaidis, Bob Reedy, Caroline Breton, Jean-Philippe Nicot, and Ellen Rathje .

My summer internship at JPL, while fully remote, was a fun and valuable learning experience, and I owe that entirely to my mentor Cathleen Jones. I'd also like to thank Yunling Lou for all the useful advice she gave me on my career choices, as well as Heresh Fattahi for career advice and direction.

My work was supported by a grant from the NASA Earth Surface and Interior Program (80NSSC18K0467), as well as a University of Texas Graduate Continuing Fellowship. I'd like to express my gratitude to ESA for their open data policy with Sentinel-1, to the Alaska Satellite Facility for their improvements to data access, to NASA for their Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data, and to the Texas Department of Transportation and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory for their GPS data and processing. I also sincerely thank all the open source maintainers of the Python and geospatial libraries that my work was built upon.


I give a big thanks to Arjun, Rahul, Kirsten, Kristen, Erika, Vishnuu, Ben, Enrico, Courtney, Nick, Sean, Shubham, David, Corey, Lakshay, Tucker, Corinne, and the rest of my Orbits and Controls friends for all the study groups, coffee and happy hours that made these 5 years fun.

I give my thanks and my love to my Mom, Dad, and brother Matt for always supporting and encouraging me. Finally, I give my deepest thanks to Anne for taking the journey with me from Boston, and for giving unwavering support and inspiration at every step.

The Permian Basin has become the United States' largest producer of oil and gas over the past decade. During the same time, it has experienced a sharp rise in the number of induced earthquakes. In order to better understand the damage potential from induced earthquakes, new data and monitoring approaches are critically needed. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique that measures surface deformation over broad areas with 10s-100s meter spatial resolution and up to millimeter-to-centimeter accuracy. These measurements can be used to derive information about Earthâ€™s subsurface and assess induced seismic risks. However, it is difficult to perform basin-scale surface deformation mapping and automatic feature detection using InSAR because the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the deformation signals compared to tropospheric noise is extremely low. It is common to assume that the Permian Basin is rigid enough that the subtle deformation associated with oil and gas production and wastewater injection are not detectable by InSAR.

In this dissertation, we develop methods for characterizing tropospheric noise and its power spectral density directly from InSAR observations. We show that the tropospheric noise distribution is non-Gaussian, and a small portion of SAR scenes are corrupted by up to $\pm$ 15 cm noise outliers associated with storms and heat waves. This finding is significant because most of the InSAR time series solutions are optimal only when noise follows a Gaussian distribution. We design robust and scalable time series algorithms to reconstruct the temporal evolution of surface deformation in this challenging scenario, and we achieved basin-wide millimeter-level accuracy based on independent GPS validation. We observe numerous subsidence and uplift features near active production and disposal wells, as well as linear deformation patterns associated with fault activities near clusters of induced earthquakes. Furthermore, we designed  a new computer vision algorithm for detecting the size and location of unknown deformation features in large volumes of InSAR data. We are able to determine whether a detected feature is associated with tropospheric artifacts or real deformation signals based on a realistic tropospheric noise model derived from InSAR data.
