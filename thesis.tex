\section{Dislocation (Fault Slip) Model}
\label{appen:okada}
\cite{Okada1992InternalDeformationDue} derived the analytical surface displacement field due to a finite rectangular fault slip in an elastic half-space. The Okada solutions provide three cases of displacement on a fault: strike-slip, dip-slip, tensile opening. In this study, we focused on the dip-slip case, because the Pecos area is in a normal faulting regime \cite{LundSnee2018}.  The assumption of predominant dip-slip along normal faults is also supported by fault plane solutions (TexNet Earthquake Catalog). 

Considering the case of dip slip on a finite rectangular fault (Figure \ref{fig:model-fault-geom}), the vertical surface displacement $u_z(x, y, 0)$ can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	u_{z}(x,y,0)=\frac{U_{2}}{2\pi }[u_{2}^{B}\sin \delta + u_{3}^{B}\cos \delta]
	\label{eq:okada}
\end{equation}
where $U_2$ is the magnitude of dip slip. The rest of terms on the right are determined by fault geometry parameters: the fault dip angle ($\delta$), the depth to the top of the fault ($Z$), the fault width along the dip direction ($W$), and the fault length along the strike direction ($L$). 

We located four faults based on InSAR observations, and assumed a uniform slip on each fault. We estimated the best-fit fault parameters for each fault independently by minimizing the objective function \cite{Du1992}:
\begin{equation}
	\arg \min_{U_{2,i}} \left \| \mathbf{G_i}U_{2,i}-\mathbf{d_i} \right \|^2_{2}  
	\label{eq:model-obj-1}
\end{equation}	  	
where $\mathbf{G_i}$ is the discrete Greenâ€™s function that maps a dip slip, $U_{2,i}$, on the $i^{th}$ rectangular fault to the observed vertical deformation at specific surface locations.  $\mathbf{G_i}$ is a function of fault geometry parameters as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:okada}. $\mathbf{d_i}$ is a vector of vertical deformation observations associated with the $i^{th}$ fault from InSAR data.

Through a grid-search, we solved for the fault dip angle, the depth to the top of the fault, the width along the dip direction, and the magnitude of dip slip on each fault to minimize the sum of squared residuals normalized by the data error of 1 cm (Normalized Sum of Squared Residuals; NSSR). The fault length in the strike direction is set to be sufficiently long to satisfy the plane strain condition. As an example, Figure \ref{fig:fault-supplement-nssr} shows how the data misfit varies with fault parameters for fault \#3. The maximum R-squared ($R^2$) values for the best-fit fault parameters are in the range of 0.95 and generally agree with the fault parameters that satisfy the minimum NSSR. 

The best-fit fault parameters of the four faults are listed in Table \ref{tab:geo-mech-fault}, which produce 3D surface deformation patterns as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fault-model-xyz}. To illustrate how surface deformation observations are related to the model parameters, Figure \ref{fig:fault-supplement2} shows the estimated surface subsidence associated with the fault \#3 long the B-B' transect with various fault properties. The ratio of the uplift volume to the subsidence volume is a function of the seismic potency and the fault dip angle \cite{Segall2019integrated}. Based on the results in Figure \ref{fig:fault-supplement2} (a), the fault dip angle dominantly controls the uplift volume relative to the subsidence volume. The slope from the uplift on the footwall to the subsidence on the hanging wall becomes steeper as the fault becomes shallower (Figure \ref{fig:fault-supplement2} (b)). The fault width, as measured along the the dip direction, mostly contributes to the width of the subsidence bowl (Figure \ref{fig:fault-supplement2} (c)).  The dip-slip magnitude only has impact on the amplitude of the curve without any influence on the shape of the surface deformation (Figure \ref{fig:fault-supplement2} (d)).

\section{ Cylindrical Reservoir Compaction/Subsidence Model}
\label{appen:model-compact}
\cite{Geertsma1973LandSubsidenceCompacting} derived the surface displacement field due to a uniform pressure drop of a cylindrical reservoir at a depth $D$ (Figure \ref{fig:model-reservoir-geom}). Under the assumption that the reservoir radius $R$ is larger than the reservoir height $H$, the cylindrical reservoir deforms primarily in the vertical direction. The magnitude of the reservoir compaction $\Delta H$ due to a pressure drop $\Delta P$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta H = H c_m \Delta P
	\label{eq:rcompact}
\end{equation}
Here the  uniaxial compaction coefficient $c_m$ can be expressed as
\begin{align}
	c_{m} &= \alpha_{p}\frac{1+\nu}{1-\nu}\frac{c_{b}}{3} 
\end{align}
where $\alpha_p$ is Biot's coefficient, $c_b$ is the bulk compressibility, and $\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio. Surface vertical deformation $u_z$ due to the reservoir compaction $\Delta H$ can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
	u_{z}(r,0) &= 2(1-\nu)\Delta HA(\rho,\eta) 
	\label{eq:reservoirDef}
\end{align}
where $ A(\rho,\eta) = R\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-D\alpha}J_{1}(\alpha R)J_{0}(\alpha r) \, d\alpha$, $\rho = r/R$, and $\eta =  D/R$. The maximum surface deformation at $r = 0$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	{u_{z}}^{max} = 2(1-\nu)\Delta H(1-\frac{\eta}{\sqrt{1+\eta^{2}}})
\end{equation}

The best-fit compaction in the cylindrical reservoirs were determined by minimizing the objective function \cite{Du2001}:
\begin{equation}
	\arg \min_{\mathbf{\Delta H}} =\left \| \mathbf{G_R}\mathbf{\Delta H}-\mathbf{d_r} \right \|^2+\beta ^2\left \| \mathbf{H_L}\mathbf{\Delta H}-\mathbf{d_0} \right \|^2  \label{eq:model-obj-2}
\end{equation}
where $ \mathbf{G_R} $ is the discrete Greenâ€™s function that maps the compaction of cylindrical reservoirs $\mathbf{\Delta H}$ in the subsurface to the observed vertical deformation at specific surface locations. $\mathbf{G_R}$ is a function of reservoir geometry parameters as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:reservoirDef}. $\mathbf{d_r}$ is a vector of vertical deformation observations associated with the reservoir compaction. In this study, $\mathbf{d_r}$ is the difference between the InSAR-observed total vertical deformation and modeled vertical fault slip deformation, $ \beta^2 $ is the penalty factor that weights the smoothness constraint, and $ \mathbf{H_L} $ is the finite difference approximation of the Laplacian operator. The reservoir compaction is constrained to be negative, and $\mathbf{d_0} $ is set to be zero. 

Based on the production well data near Pecos, we discretized two layers of reservoirs in the subsurface: Delaware Mountain Group (DMG) at depth 1.52 km and Wolfcamp at depth 3.05 km (Figure \ref{fig:model-reservoir-wells}). The shallow groundwater level reservoirs were not included in the reservoir model, because the water levels in the groundwater aquifers in the Pecos area were stable over the time period of interest \cite{deng2020surface}. The producing wells in the DMG were predominantly located to the east of Pecos, and we set 25 cylindrical reservoirs with the radius of 0.83 km. In the Wolfcamp formation, the wells were producing over the entire region. We discretized the layer covering the entire area with 100 cylindrical reservoirs with the radius of 0.83 km.

	\label{fig:model-reservoir-wells}
\end{figure}



We utilized the pattern search optimization tool in MATLAB to minimize the objective function (Equation \eqref{eq:model-obj-2}). As the penalty factor $\beta^2$ decreases, the NSSR decreases, $ R^2 $ increases, and the modeled surface deformation better matches the InSAR data (Figure \ref{fig:model-reservoir-nssr}). Once the penalty factor ($ \beta^2 $) is smaller than 0.01, the NSSR and $ R^2 $ no longer change substantially. The best-fit reservoir compaction results ($ \beta^2 $ equals 0.01) for the two producing layers are shown in Figure \ref{fig:model-reservoir-wells}. While DMG reservoirs show some compaction (0 - 8 cm), the dominant compaction is in the Wolfcamp layer (0 - 27 cm). The production volume in DMG is as significant as in Wolfcamp. However, the dominant injection volume into DMG could maintain the reservoir pressure and minimize reservoir compaction. For certain regions in the Wolfcamp layer, the reservoir compaction appears to be discontinuous given the low $ \beta^2 $ value. We note that it is reasonable to observe localized compaction for tight shale formations, because the low formation permeability can cause heterogeneous pressure distribution during the depletion.

If appropriate mechanical properties of the formation are available, the distribution of reservoir pressure change and depleted zone can be evaluated by the reservoir compaction magnitudes based on Equation \eqref{eq:rcompact}. For example, if we assume Youngâ€™s modulus of 25 GPa, Poissonâ€™s ratio of 0.25, and Biotâ€™s coefficient of 0.67 based on published rock properties \cite{Shukla2013NanoindentationStudiesShales, Xu2015AnalysisStressVariations}, the localized maximum pressure drop is approximately 21 MPa. This is within a reasonable range given operational history in the area.

%\section{Disambiguating terms from fractal surfaces, Gaussian random
%	fields, and power
%	laws}
%\label{disambiguating-terms-from-fractal-surfaces-gaussian-random-fields-and-power-laws}
%
%Part that I wanted to write down:
%
%Another way to consider fractals: If you generate white or pink noise, unlike human speech or music, it will sound the same at any speed.
%
%Note on Brownian motion being an integral of white noise.
%For any complex sinusoid $x(t) = e^{j2 \pi f t}$ of frequency $f$, the effect in the frequency domain can found by noting that 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\int x(t) \, dt = \frac{1}{j 2 \pi f} e^{j2\pi f t} = \frac{1}{j 2 \pi f} x(t)
%\end{equation}
%
%Since integration is linear and time invariant, we can think of it as an LTI filter $h$ with frequency response $H_i(f) = \frac{1}{j 2 \pi f} $, which has a $|1/f|$ magnitude response, or $|1/f^2|$ in power.
%
%A white noise process $w(t)$ can be defined as having a flat power spectral density (PSD) $S_W(f) = \sigma^2$. Integrating white noise results in the PSD being shaped into $S_W(f) H_i(f) = \sigma / f^2$.
%
%\textbf{Driving question}:
%
%Is the fractal atmospheric surface (a type of spatially correlated
%noise), which has a power-law power spectrum of
%
%\[S(f) = (1/f)^{\beta}\] also a Gaussian random field?
%
%The three related subjects are\ldots{} - Gaussian Fields - Fractal
%surfaces - Power-law power spectra Can all three be present? Or are some
%mutually exclusive?
%
%\textbf{POSSIBLE SUMMARY ANSWER}
%
%Yes, the surface can be 1. fractal, since the structure function (aka
%semi-variogram) of the atmospheric delay has a power-law form (Hanssen,
%Eq 4.7.10) \footnote{Hanssen, Ramon F. Radar interferometry: data
%	interpretation and error analysis. Vol. 2. Springer Science \&
%	Business Media, 2001.} :
%
%\[D_s(\rho) \sim \rho^{5/3}\]
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	
%	\item
%	A Gaussian field, since by (Cressie, 1993) Eq. 5.5.1 \footnote{Cressie,
%		Noel. Statistics for spatial data. John Wiley \& Sons, 2015.},
%\end{enumerate}
%
%More generally, a fractional Brownian motion in \(R^d\) is a Gaussian
%process \(Z(\cdot)\) characterized by a covariance function of the form
%with
%
%\[C(s, t) = \frac{1}{2}\left(s^{2H} + t^{2H} + |s-t|^{2H}\right)\]
%
%and a variogram of the form
%
%\[E[(Z(s + h) - Z(s))^2] \propto ||h||^{2H}\] So, for the Hanssen
%structure fucntion, \(H=5/6\)
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
%	\setcounter{enumi}{2}
%	
%	\item
%	A signal power law power spectrum \(S(k)\) of the form (Hanssen Eq.
%	4.7.12)
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\[P(k) = P_0 \left(f/f_0\right)^{-\beta}\] where \(P_0\) is the power at
%reference frequency \(f_0\) and \(\beta\) is called the \emph{spectral
%	index}. The structure function of a signal with this power spectrum can
%be written, using the same \(\beta\), as
%\[D_{\phi}(\rho) \propto \rho^{\beta-1}\] which means that if the
%structure function exponent is \(5/3\), then \(\beta=8/3\) for the
%spectrum slope.
%
%
%(NOTE: This integral is why the vertical-line average has a slope that's 1 less than the isotropic k slope: \url{https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integral+of+1+%2F+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+dy+from+-c+to+c}
%Start with $1 / r^2 = 1/(x^2 + y^2)$.
%Then change to x/y from polar, integrate over y. it tends to 1/x for large x.
%
%My confusion earlier: thinking that the frequency content of the signal
%was doing to dictate the amplitude distribution in space (or time for
%1D)\ldots{} In the same way that noise can be white (a
%frequency/spectrum description) and either uniform or Gaussian (a time
%or space description), the random process can be a Gaussian process, but
%have the same power-law exponent.
%
%LAST QUESTIONs: - BIGGEST UNKNOWN: Hanssen says the structure
%functions/SMV is \(\rho^{5/3}\), which means in never levels off, and he says the covariance function doesn't exist\ldots{} - Does this imply that it can't be a Gaussian field? - \textbf{ANSWER}: most places seem to say that fractional brownian motion is still a Gaussian field (Brownian sheet having covariance = min(s, t)) - 
%
%\textbf{TODO} This means it has stationary increments, but isn't 2nd order stationary\ldots I thought other places said ``Gaussian random fields are 2nd order stationary (and sometimes strictly stationary under some condition)'' - or does out limit study area + ramp removal mean in practice it levels off\ldots{} - if a random field is Gaussian, does it's structure func/SMV have to be gaussian?\ldots{}. 
%
%NO. Thats related to the Covariance FUNCTION\ldots aka, the covariance of the Gaussian variables at a given distance apart! the further away, the different the
%covariance is\ldots but the entire process is still only characterized by it's mean (assumed 0), and covariance function (related to the structure function) - SO, a power-law SMV is fine for a Gaussian process. and it will have a power law power-spectrum by FT:
%https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2173780/computing-fourier-transform-of-power-law
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	
%	\item
%	I thought that Gaussian processes had have Gaussian Fourier
%	transforms\ldots{}
%	
%	\begin{itemize}
%		
%		\item
%		answer? the power spectrum relates to the FT of the covariance
%		function of a (second order stationary process) (or, with different
%		terms, ACF <->PSD)
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item
%	so i think ``fractal'' descriptions are orthogonal to both ``Gaussian
